## Typelevel full-stack demo app

This is a demonstration of a full-stack Scala 3 application that we write during [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/6NHEGejBQ0w).

At a MUCH greater length and in greater detail, we write a _production-grade_ full-stack application in the [Typelevel Rite of Passage](https://rockthejvm.com/p/typelevel-rite-of-passage) course, starting from the basic ideas in this tutorial.

### How to use this code

Option 1 - clone the repo and write your app on top of it

Option 2 - clone the repo, checkout the `start` tag and follow along with the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/6NHEGejBQ0w) - this is how you can get the maximum lessons out of the video.
